export const PRIMARY_CAUSE_HINTS = {
  turbulence: "Unexpected air disturbance causing wing collapse or loss of control. Often from thermal activity, rotor zones, or weather fronts.",
  wrong_control_input: "The pilot caused the incident through aggressive maneuvers, excessive brake application, initiating steep turns, aggressive throttle use, or losing grip of the brake, among other incorrect control inputs.",
  hardware_failure: "Mechanical or structural failure of equipment during flight. Motor, frame, lines, wing material, or other component failure.",
  powerline_collision: "Contact with or near-miss of power lines. Often hard to see, especially in low light or when focused on landing.",
  midair_collision: "Collision or near-collision with another aircraft. Includes getting caught in wake turbulence from nearby traffic.",
  lines_brakes_issues: "Tangled lines, knotted brakes, or obstructions preventing proper wing control. Often discovered during launch or in flight.",
  water_landing: "Unplanned landing in water. Particularly dangerous due to weight of motor and entanglement risk.",
  preflight_error: "Issue that should have been caught during preflight check. Includes assembly errors, forgotten steps, or missed damage.",
  ground_starting: "Incidents occurring during ground handling or launch phase. Wing inflation problems, tripping, obstacles, or launch technique issues.",
  ground_object_collision: "Impact with trees, buildings, vehicles, or other ground obstacles. Often during approach or emergency landing.",
  rain_fog_snow: "Flight in or into precipitation or low visibility conditions. Can affect wing performance, weight, and pilot visibility."
